# BabyShop
### About BabyShop 
- This project is a simple E-Commerce website created by [Aditya Arpan](https://linktr.ee/arpanaditya) using HTML and CSS. 
- The aim of this project is to provide baby products on rent.
- It is because, babies as well as small kids really grows very fast. So, in that case many of their clothes are just thrown away as they are no longer to be needed. Some well-to-do families who can afford their babies a good lifestyle have many pairs of clothes whereas some below average families who cannot afford their babies a good lifestyle have very few clothes. My project which is now in under development can be a great opportunity for them. 
- Using our website, they can rent baby clothes and other items like carry pouch bag, safety car seat, bed, swing, jackets, hoodies, sweaters etc. Keeping the safety of customers in eye, we're not allowing personal healthcare products like nutrition, supplements, sanitary items, foods, oil, powder and many more for rent. The customer can take rent upto some periods and after that he/she may request the buyer and renew that period once again. The customer has to pay a little bit low amount for that same product as compared to it's market value. The advertisement regading the products will be posted by some user. The customer have to contact that user and by their mutual aggrement, this transaction can take place.
- Through this website we are also creating job opportunity. Some of the unemployed person can apply for babysitters(nannies) and can earn some money for their living too. We have complete details, ID and address proof of that applicant, so that all the time we can track the applicant and also his/her activities as well. At the time of applying, we'll ask the person to upload a CV like document containing information about himself/herself and hobbies and some tits bits about that person. It will be helpful to that person who is going to hire a person for babysitters and will get to know about that person so that they'll have an idea to whom they're giving their baby.
- This project is open for contribution and development.
