                    <p>2.Why is this web app special then a second hand shop or jobs online app?</p>
                    <p>This web
                        app is different because is only for the education, the happiness and the future of a baby.
                        A lot of persons are aborting because they can not afford clothes even from second hand but here,
                        there are donations that can be useful to them. Many people do not have a job and maybe they do not
                        want a stable job because they do not know if they like it or not, here they find job ads only
                        for a limited period of time 2-3 hours or even less. If you like this job without spending weeks
                        looking for a job and having no results.

                    <p>This web application
                        has the role of finding a job that will perhaps develop a hide passion of yours for
                        children, to help you in stopping the sale of clothes and pollution, but also in renting some products
                        that you do not want to sell but at the moment you have nothing to do with them. So you don not buy something
                        you just use that thing: clothes, crib, suit and you give it back.
